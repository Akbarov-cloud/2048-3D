# 2048-3D
2048 Clone made with Unity 3D

The code for this game was done from scratch with Unity v4.3 with a different approach than the original version. The only thing I implemented from Gabriele Cirulli was the chance to get a 2 or 4 tile.

The game was updated to Unity v5.4 recently to create a WebGL build that can be played here: https://nosmirck.itch.io/2048-3d

The UI was implemented using text mesh with colliders previous to the UGUI update on v4.6.

The code is "as is" with no warranty.

Attribute is needed to use under commercial or non-commercial use.
